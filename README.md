# Why

This project started as an attempt to learn and teach others Swift language. 

It contains examples of various features (the goal is to have 100% coverage, but 99% is ok too ðŸ¤ª). 

It also started from the very 1st ðŸ¥‡ Swift version and it's been updated to the latest version.

## Project Structure

```
.
â””â”€â”€ contents
    â”œâ”€â”€ AccesControl 
    â””â”€â”€ swift_from_zero_to_hero.playground
```

* **AccesControl** - example project to showcase access control in Swift (they are different in Swift)
* **swift_from_zero_to_hero.playground** - all other *core* features with some additional info.

## How to work with it

Just download/clone the repository and open desired page. You can play around, add, remove and check how things work. 

I personally use it as a *glosarry* of language *how to*-s.

## Latest fully supported Swift version: **5.4**

## Work in progress Swift version: **4.4**

## Translation to English %: 90
